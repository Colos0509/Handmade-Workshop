| All code has been written by Karsten Vermeulen as part of the 'Handmade' game engine, for the |
| purposes of educating other fellow programmers, programming students and anyone else wishing  |
| to learn about game development, C++ and OOP. The engine, class design and overall structure  |
| is by no means perfect and there is certainly room for improvement. Feel free to use, copy,   |
| break, update and do as you wish with this code - it is there, free, for all!                 |
|																							    |
| Designed to teach. Made from scratch. Built by hand.							                |
