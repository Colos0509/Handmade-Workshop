# Handmade

_Handmade_ is an educational game engine, written by Karsten Vermeulen for the purposes of educating other fellow programmers, programming students and anyone else wishing to learn about game development, _C++_ and _OOP_. The engine, class design and overall structure is by no means perfect and there is certainly room for improvement. Feel free to use, copy, break, update and do as you wish with this code - it is there, free, for all!
                                                                                              
#### Designed to teach. Made from scratch. Built by hand. 

# Copyright Notice

Please note, that this project is __not__ _open source_ and therefore has no license affiliated with it.

Please be respectful and do __not__ distribute the engine or its code as your own work. You may alter or tweak the engine code as a learning experience and you may also _borrow_ some code and functionality and use it to create your own game engine or game.
